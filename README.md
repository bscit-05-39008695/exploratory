# Exploratory-data-analysis
I first performed EDA on the insuarance.csv file
This involved:- viewing the basic information,
describing the data,
Finding the duplicates in the data set,
Droping the duplicates,
Finding if there are any null values,
Visualizing the unique data.

#Linear regression
I then proceeded to perform linear regression with age as my x values and the charges as my y values and ploted the graph
After linear regression i calculated MAE,MSE and RMSE.
